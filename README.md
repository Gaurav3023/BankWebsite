# Group 21 - Bank Website

<p>
  This project aims at creating a bank website. With this website, it will have functionality such as creating and editing user accounts, making deposits and withdrawls, displaying account transactions, and transferring funds from one account to another. Every new account created will have an ID associate with them, generated by the system. To properly showcase and manage these features, we will need to implement a login system and an account system that moderates and verifies transactions made by the user.
  
This website will be created using Node.js as its backend and MongoDB as the database to manage the data. We will be using React for the front-end.
